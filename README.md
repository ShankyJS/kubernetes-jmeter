# kubernetes-jmeter
Jmeter test workload inside kubernetes.

I could not find something similar to this project and other projects did not meet my requirements, so ... let's do something that works for me and others.

# AC
* All jmeter instances inside docker container
* Fully support and ready to use helm charts
* Learn new things
* Finally contribute helm charts to [helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) repo

## Status of the Project

This project is in bootstrap phase. I hope that in a next few weeks you found something more here.


## To Do
Everything ;)
* Docker images
* Visualziation stack
* Helm charts
