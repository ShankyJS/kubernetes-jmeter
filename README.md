# kubernetes-jmeter
Jmeter test workload inside kubernetes.

Any similar projects did not meet my expectation, so ... let's do something that works for me and others.

# AC
*   All jmeter instances inside docker container
*   Fully support and ready to use helm charts
*   Learn new things
*   Finally contribute helm charts to [helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) repo

## Status of the Project

Currently jmeter is able to run some test on distributed slaves but there still is a lot to do. In few days there should be some documentation added to this repo. Also charts noted is still not added to master branch, I hope it would be add soon. 


## To Do
Everything ;)
*   Docker images - 50% done
*   Visualization stack (Grafana + influxdb)
*   Helm charts - 60% done
*   Jmeter test get from maven - 0%
